          <p>Cookies help you make your online experience more efficient and relevant to your interests.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What is a Cookie?</h3>
          <p>A cookie is a small file, or files on your computer, phone, or other device with a browser to save snippets of text for reference by the website you are visiting. All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
            <li><strong>Session cookies</strong> - these are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> - these usually have an expiration date and so stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them. For example we use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so that we can improve the site for our customers.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Cookies are grouped into the following categories:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
            <li><strong>Essential</strong> - these are cookies that are required for the regular operation of our websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional</strong> - these remember your preferences, and are intended to make your experience on our websites better for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong> â€“ these cookies are used for performance measurement to understand things including how many people visit our websites, how they navigate our sites, and what content is popular. This allows us to improve your experience with us.</li>
